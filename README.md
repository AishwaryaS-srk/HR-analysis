## Introduction

This project involves HR data analysis where we have the attendance data of employees over three months. The key tasks are to clean the data, automate the cleaning process, and create new measures to derive useful insights using Power BI.

## Dataset

The dataset contains attendance details of employees for April 2022, May 2022, and June 2022. The data includes information on:
(4 sheets - Apr-2022,May-2022,Jun-2022,Attendance Key)
- Employee ID
- Employee Name
- Date
- Status (Present, Work From Home, Sick Leave, Leave)

## Requirements

- Power BI Desktop
- Excel data file (provided in the repository)

## Data Transformation

1. **Load Data**: Load the attendance data from the provided Excel files into Power BI.
2. **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries in the dataset using Power BI's data transformation tools.
3. **Clean Data**: Remove unwanted data entries based on specific criteria (e.g., erroneous entries).
4. **Automate Transformation**: Use Power BI to automate the data cleaning process for the other two months by applying the same transformation steps.

## Measures

We will calculate the following measures from the transformed data using Power BI's DAX functions:

- **Presence %**: Percentage of days an employee was present.
- **WFH %**: Percentage of days an employee worked from home.
- **SL %**: Percentage of days an employee was on sick leave.
- **Leave %**: Percentage of days an employee was on leave.

## Insights

Based on the transformed data and calculated measures, we will derive insights to help in future attendance analysis. This might include identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies in employee attendance.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/AishwaryaS-srk/HR-analysis]
```

2. **Open Power BI Desktop**.

3. **Load the Excel data files** into Power BI.

4. **Apply the data transformation steps** as described.

5. **Create measures and visualizations** to analyze the data and derive insights.
